# AMP code test

This test is designed to asses your skill level. 

Whilst We know you can see activity from other users, we feel that it's up to you, not to plagiarise the work of another person. 


## The test should only take a maximum of 2 hours, don't spend any longer!

## We are looking at the following skills:

- Responsive design
- Sass / css
- Semantics
- Accessibility
- JavaScript
- AngularJS
- Automated testing of JavaScript
- Git
- Grunt or Gulp (we use gulp here)

## The end result should be:

Simple, testable & well formatted code.

## Stuff you can leave out

- minification & concatenation
- cross browser support
- end to end testing

## Functional requirements

1. We are wanting you to display a list of users with a filter. Preferably, the list will update whilst the user is typing.
The page should be responsive. A creative has been supplied for the larger views, however, for the smaller views you'll need to use your judgement.

2. The final result should contain a mixin
3. Demonstrate good semantic markup
